// Gates the Typebot conversation's GST-number step: blocks progression

// recognition. TAN is NOT wired in here - no Studio question exists for
// it yet, and it isn't being added until asked for.
//
// Pass/fail is decided entirely by the verify provider (see
// httpVerifyProvider.js's pass/fail rule) - this gate just relays the
// provider's verdict, it never re-derives one from the response's `data`.
