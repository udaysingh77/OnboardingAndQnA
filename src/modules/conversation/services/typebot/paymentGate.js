// ==================================================================
// Holds the conversation at the payment button long enough to show the
// member everything on file.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE DIFFERENT HERE, both easy to trip over later:
//
// 1. This gate keys off the **block id**, not a variableId - see
//    paymentBlockIds.js, which owns the four ids and explains why. They
//    live in their own module so the progress-map build script can check
//    them without importing this file's env/Prisma dependencies.
//
// 2. It intercepts Typebot's **reply**, not the member's answer. Every
//    other gate inspects the message coming in; this one inspects the
//    input going back out, because the trigger is "Typebot just offered
//    the payment button".
//
// 3. A payment block is a TERMINAL state: once the member is parked on one,
//    handle() never relays their next message to Typebot. Every one of these
//    four blocks leads to a single "Thank you for your payment." text and
//    then the flow ends, so relaying anything at all made Typebot congratulate
//    a member who had not paid (and ended the session, wiping their journal).
//    Real payment runs entirely outside Typebot, through /payment/initiate and
//    the PayU callback, so that closing message is now dead - the frontend's
//    own success page is the closure.
//
// Four blocks - one per role path.
