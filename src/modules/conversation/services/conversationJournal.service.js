// ==================================================================
// Resuming an abandoned registration.
//
// THE PROBLEM: the flow asks 30-odd questions and several document
// uploads. Leaving to find a PAN card or scan a passbook is normal
// behaviour, but `typebotSessionStore` is in-memory (no TTL, gone on
// restart) and Typebot drops its own session after ~20 minutes idle, so
// a member who comes back is sent to question 1.
//
// WHY REPLAY AND NOT A CURSOR: Typebot has no resume-at-block API for a
// public chat. Verified live - `startFrom: { type: 'group', groupId }`
// is accepted but SILENTLY IGNORED by
// /api/v1/typebots/{publicId}/startChat (identical response, question
// 1). It works only on /preview/, which serves the DRAFT flow, so
// returning members would get whatever half-finished edit is open in
// Studio. So instead a fresh session is opened on the published flow and
// the member's own answers are fed back in - verified to land on the
// identical block id, file uploads included (a presigned URL minted for
// the old session is still accepted by a new one).
//
// WHY A JOURNAL AND NOT THE EXISTING COLUMNS: 38 of the flow's 131
// inputs have no variableId at all - pure navigation choices that decide
// which branch the member is on and are stored nowhere. Without them the
// path cannot be reproduced.
//
// REPLAY DELIBERATELY BYPASSES registrationEngine.handle(), talking
// straight to typebotClient. Every gate (email OTP, work link, OCR
// confirmation, payment review) lives inside handle(), and they have all
// already run for these answers: re-entering them would re-send OTPs,
// re-charge the Spotify/YouTube lookups and re-save work links against
// the 5-link cap.
