//   { provider, url, songName, artists[], filmOrAlbum, releaseYear,
//     publisher, composers[], lyricists[], producers[], credits[],
//     isMusicVideo }
//
// `credits` is what the member's name is matched against - every name
// the platform reported, whatever their role.
//
// WHERE EACH FIELD COMES FROM
//
// The in-house credits service (musicCredits.service.js) is the primary
// source for both platforms, because it is the only one that reports
// ROLES. Each platform has its own endpoint there. Spotify's Web API is
// still called alongside it, because Spotify credits carry no album or
// release date:
//
//   songName, artists, composers, lyricists, producers  - credits service
//   filmOrAlbum, releaseYear   - Spotify Web API on the Spotify path;
//                                the InnerTube music header on YouTube's
//   publisher                  - credits service `source`, else the
//                                album's P-line copyright
//
// Every credits-service field degrades: if it is disabled, unreachable,
// or has nothing for the link, the resolver falls back entirely to the
// old pair (Spotify Web API / oEmbed + Gemini-on-title) and simply
// returns no role-labelled credits. The chat step must never break
// because a metadata service is down.
//
// GROUNDED DATA ONLY still holds: every field above is read from an API
// response or copied out of a title/description. Nothing is inferred
// from what a model happens to know about the song. LanguageNames,
// WorkCategory and DocLink remain absent - nothing here can source them
// truthfully, and IPRS is a rights society. See AGENTS.md.
