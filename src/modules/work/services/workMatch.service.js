// ==================================================================
// Does this song's credits include the member - and how much is that
// worth?
//
// HOW NAMES ARE COMPARED
//
// Indian names make a plain string comparison useless in both
// directions. A PAN card says "RAHUL KUMAR SHARMA" while the release
// credits "Rahul Sharma"; "Allah Rakha Rahman" is credited "A.R.
// Rahman". Requiring the strings to be equal rejects the member's own
// songs. But loosening it to "is this name somewhere in that string"
// lets a bare "Singh" match half the catalogue.
//
// So names are compared as tokens, and the rule is: the FIRST and LAST
// tokens must correspond; everything in between is ignored.
//
//   first/last correspond when they are equal, when one is the other's
//   initial ("a" ~ "allah"), or when they differ by a single typo
//   (tokens of 4+ characters only - at 3 characters an edit is a
//   different name, not a slip).
//
// That accepts a dropped middle name, an initial, and a one-letter
// typo, while still requiring both ends of the name to line up - so
// "Arijit Kumar" does not match "Arijit Singh".
//
// A single-token name is handled asymmetrically, on purpose. A credit
// of one token is a stage mononym ("Pritam", "Badshah") and may match
// the member's first or last token. But a single token supplied by the
// *member* must equal the whole credit or its first token - otherwise
// typing "Singh" would match "Arijit Singh". The credits come from the
// platform; what the member types has to be more specific than that.
//
// A YouTube video title is a sentence, not a name, so it is matched
// separately (`creditText`) with a word-boundary containment test, and
// only for names of two or more tokens - the same "Singh" guard.
//
// WHAT A MATCH IS WORTH
//
//   trusted - AccountName (from an identity document) or AccountAlias
//             (the stage name asked during registration). Both were on
//             file *before* the member saw this song's credits.
//   claimed - a name the member gave at the work-link step, i.e. after
//             we showed them the credit list. Copying a name off that
//             list is trivial, so a match here is the member's claim,
//             not a check, and the work link is stored unverified.
//
// A claimed alias stays claimed on later songs too - being in the alias
// table doesn't promote it. See AGENTS.md.
